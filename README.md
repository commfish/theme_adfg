# theme\_adfg

A ggplot2 theme for reproducible figures in R.



Building upon the work of others, and in collaboration with the ADF\&G reproducibility crew and publication team, to create uniform and professional ADF\&G figures.



This work is heavily, heavily based on theme\_adfg by Justin Priest (I even stole the name) and theme\_sleek by Andrew Padilla. In fact, most of the base code is theirs and I just made tiny edits.



This theme is still a work in progress.



### To do:

* add example figs to the readme
* any Alyssa-recommended edits (waiting)
* make the readme professional- see other examples (how to load the theme in R, etc.)
* a reference to color and adfg\_colors
* add links to the other mentioned themes
* clean up code- the hashtags mostly
